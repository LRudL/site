        <p><em>Together with <a href="https://lukedrago.substack.com/https://lukedrago.substack.com/">Luke Drago</a>, we’ve published an essay series on what we call the intelligence curse. Most content is brand new, and all previous writing has been heavily reworked.</em></p>
<p><em>Visit <a href="http://intelligence-curse.ai/">intelligence-curse.ai</a> for the full series.</em></p>
<p><em>Below is the introduction and table of contents.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/cover.jpg"/></p>
<p>We will soon live in <a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/">the intelligence age</a>. What you do with that information will determine your place in history.</p>
<p>The imminent arrival of AGI has pushed many to try to <a href="https://danfaggella.com/flex/">seize the levers of power as quickly as possible</a>, leaping towards projects that, if successful, would comprehensively automate all work. There is a <a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/per/insights/market-insights/investment-outlook/ai-investment/#:~:text=According%20to%20data,Exhibit%2014).">trillion-dollar</a> arms race to see who can achieve such a capability first, with <a href="https://www.mechanize.work/#:~:text=The%20market%20potential%20here%20is%20absurdly%20large%3A%20workers%20in%20the%20US%20are%20paid%20around%20%2418%20trillion%20per%20year%20in%20aggregate.%20For%20the%20entire%20world%2C%20the%20number%20is%20over%20three%20times%20greater%2C%20around%20%2460%20trillion%20per%20year.">trillions more</a> in gains to be won.</p>
<p>Yes, that means you’ll lose your job. But it goes beyond that: this will remove the need for regular people in our economy. Powerful actors—like states and companies—no longer have an incentive to care about regular people. We call this <strong>the intelligence curse</strong>.</p>
<p>If we do nothing, the intelligence curse will work like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful AI will push automation through existing organizations, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.   </li>
<li>AI will obsolete even outlier human talent. Social mobility will stop, ending the social dynamism and progress that it drives.   </li>
<li>Non-human factors of production, like capital, resources, and control over AI, will become overwhelmingly more important than humans.   </li>
<li>This will usher in incentives for powerful actors around the world that break the modern social contract.  </li>
<li>This could result in the <a href="https://gradual-disempowerment.ai/">gradual</a>—or <a href="https://www.forethought.org/research/ai-enabled-coups-how-a-small-group-could-use-ai-to-seize-power">sudden</a>—disempowerment of the vast majority of humanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this prophecy is not yet fulfilled; we <em>reject</em> the view that this path is inevitable. We see a different future on the horizon, but it will require a deliberate and concerted effort to achieve it. </p>
<p>We aim to change the incentives driving the intelligence curse, maintaining human economic relevance and strengthening our democratic institutions to withstand what will likely be the greatest societal disruption in history.</p>
<p>To break the intelligence curse, we should chart a different path on the tech tree<em>,</em> building technology that lets us:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avert</strong> AI catastrophes by hardening the world against them, both because it is good in itself and because it removes the security threats that drive calls for centralization.  </li>
<li><strong>Diffuse</strong> AI, to get it in the hands of regular people. In the short-term, build AI that augments human capabilities. In the long-term, align AI directly to individual users and give everyone control in the AI economy.   </li>
<li><strong>Democratize</strong> institutions, making them more anchored to the needs of humans even as they are buffeted by the changing incentive landscape and fast-moving events of the AGI transition.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this series of essays, we examine the incoming crisis of human irrelevance and provide a map towards a future where people remain the masters of their destiny.</p>

<h2 id="section-0">Chapters</h2>
<h3 id="section-1">1. <strong>Introduction</strong> (this page)</h3>
<p>We will soon live in the intelligence age. What you do with that information will determine your place in history.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">2. <strong><a href="pyramid/">Pyramid Replacement</a></strong></h3>
<p>Increasingly powerful AI will trigger pyramid replacement: a systematic hollowing out of corporate structures that starts with entry-level hiring freezes and moves upward through waves of layoffs.</p>
<h3 id="section-3">3. <strong><a href="capital/">Capital, AGI, and Human Ambition</a></strong></h3>
<p>AI will make non-human factors of production more important than human ones. The result may be a future where today's power structures become permanent and frozen, with no remaining pathways for social mobility or progress.</p>
<h3 id="section-4">4. <strong><a href="defining/">Defining the Intelligence Curse</a></strong></h3>
<p>With AGI, powerful actors will lose their incentive to invest in regular people–just as resource-rich states today neglect their citizens because their wealth comes from natural resources rather than taxing human labor. This is the intelligence curse.</p>
<h3 id="section-5">5. <strong><a href="shaping/">Shaping the Social Contract</a></strong></h3>
<p>The intelligence curse will break the core social contract. While this suggests a grim future, understanding how economic incentives reshape societies points to a solution: we can deliberately develop technologies that keep humans relevant.</p>
<h3 id="section-6">6. <strong><a href="breaking/">Breaking the Intelligence Curse</a></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Avert</strong> AI catastrophes with technology for safety and hardening without requiring centralizing control. <strong>Diffuse</strong> AI that differentially augments rather than automates humans and decentralizes power. 
<strong>Democratize</strong> institutions, bringing them closer to regular people as AI grows more powerful.</p>
<h3 id="section-7">7. <strong><a href="history/">History is Yours to Write</a></strong></h3>
<p>You have a roadmap to break the intelligence curse. What will you do with it?</p>
